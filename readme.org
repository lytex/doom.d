* Setup
I use hard links, so that links are not followed (may clash with your directory structure if already has links)
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; Allow hardlinks to be opened in its own directory
(setq find-file-existing-other-name nil)
(setq find-file-visit-truename nil)
#+END_SRC
The purpose of that is two-fold:
- If do a soft link Documents -> org, then org-noter doesn't work because it cannot open the .org file associated with the .pdf  properly
- If do a soft link org -> Documents, then org-roam doesn't work because it cannot create a new roam file if you write a non-existing link
- The solution is to create hard links of both .org and associated .pdf files, so that:
  1. org-noter works because the .pdf file is in the same folder
  2. org-roam works because it can recognize org files without following a link
